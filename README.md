# CoolLine (classic updated)

![](https://github.com/LoneWanderer-GH/CoolLine/workflows/Retail-Classic-Build/badge.svg)

Shows cooldowns on a single bar for World of Warcraft classic and retail.

It is the original CoolLine modified to be compatible with an addon I made: [ElvUI_CoolLine_Wrapper](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/elvui-coolline-wrapper)
